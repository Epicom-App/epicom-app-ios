# This file provides an overview of code owners in this repository.

# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
# The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# For more details, read the following article on GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
