## Building the iOS App

Currently the iOS App cannot be build on checkout, because the xcconfig configuration files are not under source control. If you are interested in contributing, please write us under epicom@appsfactory.de. We will try to provide some mocking data then. Please also follow the guidelines below.

## Did you find a bug?

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under Issues
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change in a mail to epicom@appsfactory.de
* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
